## Models Used for database:

- I have used two models Product and variant

### Product Model:

| Field          | Type     | Description                |
| -------------- | -------- | -------------------------- |
| _id            | ObjectId | Unique identifier          |
| name           | String   | Name of the product        |
| description    | String   | Description of the product |
| price          | Number   | Price of the product       |

### Variant Model:

| Field            | Type     | Description                           |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| _id              | ObjectId | Unique identifier                     |
| name             | String   | Name of the variant                   |
| sku              | String   | Stock Keeping Unit (SKU),(Unique)     |
| additional_cost  | Number   | Additional cost compared to base cost |
| stock_count      | Number   | Stock count of the variant            |
| productId        | ObjectId | Reference to the parent product       |

- sku is unique id as stock keeping unit should be treat as unique identifier so if you get an error in variant api then check your sku if its unique or not.
